Work in progress.

Research work to create connected views of Linked Data.

This uses NodeJS, with Fuseki and Mongo. It indexes JSON data (currently outputs from Annalist, see http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.290669 ) and produces web pages based on that data using reusable templates based on the predicats and objects of an entity.
